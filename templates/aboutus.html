<p>Taking this I was expecting Computer Science to be easy and simple but it was much harder that I thought. We started learning Python and then we shifted to Html and CSS. We learned Flask and Jinga as well. Going into this class I knew nothing but after these past few months I have learned quite a bit and am glad I took this class. Computer Science is such a good subject and a very useful and important skill to learn. Coding can help you get many jobs and at a younger age as well. Even during college. My latest challenge was REST API and as Noah said, I understand what it is and how it works including Flask Requests and JSON. I am also currently researching databases and their security as this is very important with any website. Without a secure database, no website will be trustworthy for pulling information. I will strive to improve in all aspects and learn new things as well. I really want to get the basics correct so that I donâ€™t have to constantly just copy code and paste, I want to make code and understand it conceptually. </p>

<h2>Noah Pidding:</h2>
<p>I feel that with the work we have done in this class, I have been able to learn a lot about computer science, and really grow myself as a coder. I have become fairly competent in Python programming and am working on improving my skills in this area. I can comfortably build a Python/Flask web server. I can develop web front ends using HTML, CSS, and BootStrap. And, I can somewhat understand REST APIs capabilities, Flask requests and parsing resulting data from JSON. I am looking forward to improving myself in these areas, as well as attempting to dive deeper into some of the newer areas I am unfamiliar with. </p>

<h2>Adan Holbel:</h2>
<p>I am a beginner to python but I have learned a good amount during this project. I plan to major in Computer Science in college. I can build a Python / Flask server as well as using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to develop the front end. However I still have a lot to learn with Python and I want to learn how to make an API easier since I had a lot of trouble learning how to put it into our project.</p>

<h2>Rivan Nayak:</h2>
<p>For me I had learned so many things in python which helped me become a better coder as well using that knowledge in the real world.Because of Computer Science it helped me become a better coder as well as made me go into a business computer major. I am really good at especially making a Python/Flask web server as well as good at making a quiz. Especially on our website we had to create a quiz game and Nihar and I helped each other making the quiz for our database. On top of that I can use HTML to develop web front ends as well as using bootstrap. In the future I hope I can get better at the things I need to improve on such as making an animation on our website which is really cool or doing backend work with SQL databases. I as well want to be more familiar with the future topics of python and master that so I can get a full understanding of it.</p>
