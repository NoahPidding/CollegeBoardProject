<h style="text-align:center;"><b>About Pig Latin</b></h>
<p>Pig Latin is a language code or game and is most often used by children who speak English. The usual rules are: For words that begin with consonants, move the consonant to the end of the word and add "ay." For words that begin with vowels, simply add "ay" to the end of the word. Pig Latin is a pseudo-language or argot where we use a formal technique altering English words.</p>
<p>Pig Latin seems to have been invented by American children sometime in the 1800s, originally it was called Hog Latin. Pig Latin solidified its place in the American consciousness with the release of the song Pig Latin Love in 1919.</p>
